# Ex-08-Data-Visualization-

## AIM
To Perform Data Visualization on a complex dataset and save the data to a file. 

# Explanation
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

# ALGORITHM
### STEP 1
Read the given Data
### STEP 2
Clean the Data Set using Data Cleaning Process
### STEP 3
Apply Feature generation and selection techniques to all the features of the data set
### STEP 4
Apply data visualization techniques to identify the patterns of the data.

# Which gender tends to leave higher tips?

sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='tip',data=tips)

# Is there any relationship between the total bill amount and the day of the week?

plt.plot(tips['day'],tips['total_bill'])

# How does the distribution of total bill amounts vary across different time periods (lunch vs. dinner)?

# What is the distribution of tip amounts for each day of the week?

# How does the tip amount vary based on the type of service (lunch vs. dinner)?

# Is there any correlation between the total bill amount and the tip amount?
